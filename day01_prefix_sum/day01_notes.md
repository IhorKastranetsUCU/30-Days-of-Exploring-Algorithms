This is the first day of the challenge. After a short discussion with Maksym,
we decided to start with simpler algorithms and implement them using LeetCode tasks.


## LeetCode

I completed **7 problems**, **6 of them were prefix sum problems**
(5 Fundamental and 1 Intermediate).\
I am getting used to this platform because I had never used it before.
To be honest, I got stuck on some problems and used ChatGPT to fix my solutions.
However, this time I first tried to find the mistake myself, and only when I failed
did I use AI for help.\
In three solutions written by other people, I noticed a pattern where a temporary
value is compared with a local maximum. I used this idea in one of my solutions myself:

```python
max_sum = max(max_sum, zeros_left + ones_right)
```
I had never used anything like this before.\
Additionally, I had to use class initialization in one problem, but I still don’t fully
understand how it works internally. However, it was necessary to solve the task.

## FreeCodeCamp
LeetCode uses classes, which I am not very familiar with.
That is why I decided to start a Python course on FreeCodeCamp.\
I have already completed the first two topics and plan to finish the section on classes
by the end of this week. The problems so far are very simple, and I don’t think it was
strictly necessary to complete the first two topics, but I did it anyway.\
The next topics are supposed to be more complex and contain more useful information.

## Grokking Algorythms
I started reading this book three days ago while traveling home by train.\
The first three chapters were basic for me and mainly refreshed what I studied at university.
However, starting from chapter four, I realized that I was not fully confident about some topics.\
For example, I wondered why Quick Sort is often considered better than Merge Sort,
even though Merge Sort is always O(n log n), while Quick Sort has a worst-case complexity
of O(n²).\
I also learned what a hash function is and how to determine whether it is good or bad.
The next topic introduces graphs, which is especially interesting because I have never
used this data structure before.\
I am currently on page 93.
