# Day 6

## Overol
I didn't sleep at all because of setting up `Manim` locally and on `Colab`, as well as adjusting animations.
It was a big mistake to start the challenge in the evening. Throughout the whole day, I felt exhausted and very sleepy.
I hope I will take responsibility and do all tasks in the first part of the day from now on, because the next few days 
will be very busy.
I have a walk planned with Zora, and we are going to spend a lot of time together tomorrow.
Then there will be a New Year party and classes.

## FreeCodeCamp
I finished the lab **"Debug an ISBN Validator"** at 8:30 AM at the Ternopil train station.
It wasn't very difficult, but it required clarifying the questions.


## Manim
Finally, Manim works fine on my computer, and I will be able to create animations soon.
Now I use Gemini to create visualizations for my functions. I am very excited about how well AI can do this.

## Heap sort
Well, that was the most difficult algorithm of the first weak. I watched 4 [videos](#Videos
) to understand the logic and
I still couldn't manage to understand the detailes. I asked Maksym about help and the gently explained me how
the Algorithm works with average difficulty $O(\log n)$ and the fundamental of `heap` data structure. 

Now I understand how it works and the pseudocode.
Unfortunately, this is the first algorithm that I didn't implement by myself.
I used pseudocode and AI for debugging, so I haven't solved any LeetCode problems yet.
However, I am still happy that I understood this algorithm and hope that next time I will be able to implement it on my own.
