# 30 Days of Exploring Algorithms
A daily journey into learning algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving with Python

___
## Project Overview
This repository documents the progress in programming and algorithm knowledge 
through a 30-day marathon-style challenge.

- **Programming language:** Python
- **Progress tracking:** see the [Progress](#progress) section, which contains 
  daily reflections and a summary of completed work.

Each day includes:
- Documentation of the algorithm (`algorithm.md`)
- A clean Python implementation (`algorithm.py`)
- A reflection note (`notes.md`) summarizing insights, challenges, and learning

## Goals

This project aims to improve both hard and soft skills. 
Each day will include at least one algorithm problem, while additional modules will be learned as optional material.

### Hard Skills
- **Python** – learn Python syntax to be able to implement any algorithm
- **Algorithms** – learn algorithms for searching, sorting, and graph problems
  - **Packages** – practice with `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sympy`, `argparse`, `random`, `re` and other optional packages
- **Data Structures** – learn and implement basic and advanced data structures
- **Git** – learn how to work with Git and set up a proper workflow in an IDE

### Soft Skills
- **English** – practice English while searching for information and writing documentation
- **LinkedIn** – learn how to write high-quality reflections and share progress publicly
- **GitHub** – learn to write documentation and effectively use GitHub for version control

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, where each day has its own folder named `dayXX_topic`.

There are three main branches:
- `main` – contains the final, reviewed summary of the daily work agreed upon by both contributors
- `ihor` – contains individual files, experiments, and notes created by Ihor
- `maksym` – contains individual files, experiments, and notes created by Maksym

Work is done independently in personal branches. After discussion and review, the results are merged into the `main` branch.

Each daily folder contains:
- `algorithm.md` – a shared and agreed explanation of the algorithm
- `solutions/` – independent Python implementations by each contributor
- `notes.md` – a shared daily reflection summarizing challenges, insights, and final understanding

```text
