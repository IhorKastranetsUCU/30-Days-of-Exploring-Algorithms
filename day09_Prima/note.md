# Day 9 
___
So, today was the first day when I didn't do much work, because it was New Year party
and I was hanging out with friend, I didn't sleep at all and I'm not able to focus. 

I almost solved correctly **hard** problem on LeetCode on Kruskal's algorithm but the 
time complexity was $O(E^2 \log E)$ instead of $O(E \log E)$. But even in this condition
I still try to do minimum work to still better my skills. I don't count this day as 
sucsesfull because I didn't manage to implement algorithm or even solve a problem but 
I learned how the algorithm works and implementation steps. 

In addition, I do understand
how work with classes better, and now I easly can create my own class.
