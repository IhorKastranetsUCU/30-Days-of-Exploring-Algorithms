# Day 5

So… I’m cooked. That was the least productive day of the whole holiday.
However, I managed to learn the logic of the interpolation search algorithm and 
understood its weak sides. Still, the difficulty of LeetCode problems makes me feel discouraged.

On the other hand, I started planning my travels. I decided to try Couchsurfing, 
and I suppose it’s going to give me some motivation for studying. In addition,
I’m really happy that I’m finally leaving home and going back to Lviv.

I want to go to the library and lock myself in there to study. I also clearly 
understand that without variety, I will burn out for sure. Tomorrow I have a train at 7:30 AM, 
so I’m going to read algorithm books on the way.
